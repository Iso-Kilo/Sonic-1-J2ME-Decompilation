# Sonic 1 J2ME Decompilation
A decompilation of the 2005 Java mobile port of Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). This decompilation focuses on the 240x320 resolution version, of part 1 as it uses the original game's graphics. However, there are lower resolutions that function similarily. And part 2 consists of the largest available resolution; 208x208. Part 1 was created by iFone, and 2 by Glu.

# Status
Currently the decompilation is unbuildable, and obfuscated.
Until the decompilation is usable, continue to mod via the old method of opening the original JAR as an archive and modifying MIDIs and PNGs.
